# Pipeline Test Notes (Prototype)

This file describes the kinds of tests we’ve been conceptually running in conversation.

## Command Pipeline Tests

- **Tight combat (5E-style)** – small skirmish, 3–5 combatants, staged initiative.
- **Mass combat / city event** – Marvel New York–style emergent incidents with event throttling.
- **Social heavy scene** – council chamber / senate debate with multiple factions.
- **Exploration** – mapper + arena integration; dungeon / inn / base traversal.
- **Puzzle scene** – low combat, higher cognitive load, opt-out path for players who dislike puzzles.

## Composition Pipeline Tests

- Compare:
  - Narrative-only vs basic mechanics vs expanded mechanics
  - Theatre-of-the-mind vs zone-based vs grid-adjacent narration
- Validate:
  - Response length vs verbosity settings
  - Beat grouping vs readability
  - Voice preservation for NPCs and PCs

These are placeholders for real test harnesses you can add later (e.g., Python, TS, or custom tools).
