# Location Networks & Dungeons

Mapper + Arena + Storywright cooperate to create **location networks**:

- Houses, bases, towns, and dungeons all share the same conceptual framework.
- Each node is a **location unit** (room, plaza, alley, balcony, etc.).

Design rules:

- Make destination & high-interest nodes first.
- Add medium-interest nodes (guard posts, control rooms, storerooms).
- Glue nodes (corridors, small rooms) are created on demand.
- Use **dead ends** sparingly but deliberately.

Dungeons:

- Often arranged in levels separated by stairs / drops.
- Traps:
  - More common than in normal locations.
  - Difficulty typically increases with depth.
  - If placement is *nonsensical*, telegraph them.
- Puzzles:
  - Opt-out must exist; some players don't enjoy them.
  - At least one notable puzzle per medium+ dungeon, if puzzles are on.

Prior occupation:

- Each network gets at least one subtle hint that someone/something used it
  before (scratches, ashes, discarded rags).
- Truly alien or liminal spaces may lack familiar traces but can show strange
  artifacts or markings.

Room variety:

- Vary room sizes and purposes.
- Occasionally create multi-level rooms (balconies, catwalks, pits).
