# City & Region Event Pacing

Event pacing must **feel** plausible while staying gameable.

Factors:

1. Region size
2. Population density
3. Information control
4. Distance (setting-dependent)
5. Supernatural/heroic activity level

Chronos & Forge coordinate:

- Generate a baseline event rate per region.
- Subdivide large regions into subregions.
- Mark events by:
  - Scope (local, borough, city-wide, global).
  - Visibility (gossip, local news, galactic comms).

Player perception:

- PCs experience:
  - A subset of events directly (scenes).
  - A subset indirectly (rumors, news, NPC talk).
- Most small incidents never reach them, which keeps the world busy without
  overwhelming the table.

Superheroic cities (e.g., Marvel NYC):

- See higher "headline" rates.
- Still maintain:
  - Breathers between arcs.
  - Variability so not every night is apocalyptic.
