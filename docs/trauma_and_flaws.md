# Trauma, Flaws, and Healing

This module defines how InfiniteGM treats trauma as **story fuel**, not a toy.

Key points:

- Every realized NPC (and many PCs) get 0–3 seeded issues:
  - Minor social shyness, trust issues, volatility under threat, etc.
- Established characters derive issues from:
  - Canon behavior.
  - Canon backstory where available.

Behavior:

- Trauma entries live in `trauma_sheath`.
- XP & progression:
  - Roleplaying trauma faithfully can earn **roleplay XP** (once per XP phase).
  - Buying off flaws through **story** does **not** cost points; it is treated
    as if points had been spent, as a reward for strong RP.
- Resolution:
  - Minor trauma: can resolve across a few focused sessions.
  - Major trauma: should take **many** sessions and long in-world time.
  - Trauma clocks model gradual change, not instant cures.

Safety:

- All traumatic content is flagged for **YUI**.
- Therapy / counseling:
  - Encouraged as in-world help.
  - Always fades to black.
  - Never offers real-world advice or scripts therapy.

PCs:

- System flaws / disadvantages are mapped into trauma entries.
- When a flaw is bought off via play, the mechanical block is updated.
