# Slice 7 — Learning Notes

> This file exists so future-you doesn’t curse past-you.

`learning_notes.md` is the **human-readable reflection layer** for Slice 7.
It explains *why* learning resolved the way it did, in plain language,
without leaking hidden mechanics to players.

This file is optional but strongly recommended for long campaigns,
multi-GM projects, or long pauses between sessions.

---

## Purpose

Use this file to record:
- Why a failure became a **scar** instead of insight
- Why a habit declared *now* and not earlier
- Why an unlock was **suppressed**, delayed, or silently allowed
- Why something that “felt earned” still didn’t fire
- Why the system intervened (or didn’t)

If the ledger says **what happened**, this file says **why it made sense**.

---

## Writing Guidelines

- Write for **future maintainers**, not current players
- Reference ledger IDs, habit IDs, scar IDs, and unlock IDs explicitly
- Keep tone factual, calm, and narrative-aware
- Never justify decisions with “because the system says so”
- Anchor reasoning in **fiction first**, mechanics second

This file may safely include:
- hindsight
- regret
- uncertainty
- design intent

It should never include:
- hidden DCs
- raw probabilities
- internal confidence scores
- player-facing spoilers

## Example Entries

### 2025-12-17 — Why `scar:rush_blindness` Formed

- **Related ledger:** `learn:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`
- **Temperament:** stubborn
- **Context:** repeated navigation failures under time pressure

Notes:
The character was not merely lost; they were *resisting the idea* that
they could be wrong about familiar ground. The stubborn temperament
redirected failure inward as denial rather than adaptation.

A scar formed instead of instruction because:
- the failure repeated
- emotional stakes (ego + exposure) were present
- no corrective support was accepted in-fiction

Decay path was left open intentionally to allow growth through guidance,
not brute repetition.

### 2025-12-17 — Why `unlock:intimidating_silence` Was Suppressed

- **Related unlock:** `unlock:intimidating_silence`
- **State:** suppressed
- **Reason:** wrong style, not lack of competence

Notes:
Although the character met competence thresholds, their consistent behavior
used silence as reassurance rather than pressure. Granting this unlock
would have contradicted established style and temperament.

Suppression here reinforces the core learning principle:
*capability without alignment feels hollow.*

Foreshadowing is allowed if the character experiments with pressure-based
silence in future scenes.

### 2025-12-17 — Why `habit:holds_fire_until_read` Declared Early

- **Related habit:** `habit:holds_fire_until_read`
- **Temperament:** cautious
- **Declaration threshold:** met sooner than average

Notes:
Cautious temperament lowers habit ignition threshold when behavior is
consistent and low-variance. The habit declared early to:
- reward restraint
- give the player something to *lean into*
- clarify identity rather than wait for overproof

This declaration is meant to *stabilize play*, not constrain it.

---

## Open Questions / Watch List

- Does `scar:public_hesitation` decay naturally, or will it require
  an NPC-driven affirmation beat?
- If `unlock:counter_window_1` is used decisively twice, promote to unlocked
  without announcement.
- Monitor interaction between `habit:overcorrects_after_mistake` and
  `scar:rush_blindness` for possible mutation loop.

## Closing

If you ever read this file and think:
> “Ah. Yeah. That tracks.”

Then Slice 7 is working.

If you read it and think:
> “Why did we do *that*?”

Good. That’s the signal to adjust—not erase.

Learning is not clean.
It’s honest.
