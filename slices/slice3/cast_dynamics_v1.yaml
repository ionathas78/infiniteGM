cast_dynamics:
  version: Cast.Dynamics.v1.0
  description: >
    Global behavioral physics for all Cast entities.
    These rules apply uniformly unless explicitly overridden.
    They govern how NPCs remember, change, escalate, and disappear.

  memory_rules:
    encoding:
      default_bias:
        kindness: low
        competence: moderate
        humiliation: high
        betrayal: extreme
      note: >
        Negative or status-threatening events encode more strongly
        than positive ones unless an NPC has a specific counter-trait.

    decay:
      slow:
        description: "Memory persists across long narrative gaps."
      normal:
        description: "Memory fades after several scenes unless reinforced."
      fast:
        description: "Memory fades quickly unless repeatedly triggered."

    reinforcement:
      strengthens_on:
        - repeated_exposure
        - public_visibility
        - emotional_intensity
      weakens_on:
        - long_absence
        - competing_trauma
        - narrative_resolution

  mood_drift:
    baseline:
      description: >
        NPCs begin scenes at their last known mood state.
        Mood does not reset unless narratively justified.
    drift_factors:
      - recent_success
      - recent_failure
      - social_validation
      - isolation
    inertia:
      low: "Mood shifts easily."
      moderate: "Mood resists sudden reversal."
      high: "Mood is sticky and slow to change."

  escalation_logic:
    pressure_accumulation:
      sources:
        - unmet_drives
        - repeated_humiliation
        - resource_loss
        - blocked_exit_paths
      outcome:
        description: >
          Accumulated pressure increases likelihood of rash,
          aggressive, or desperate behavior.

    deescalation_triggers:
      - face_saving_exit
      - compensation_or_concession
      - authority_intervention
      - exhaustion

  promotion_rules:
    eligibility:
      conditions:
        - repeated_player_interaction
        - survival_of_major_incident
        - possession_of_valuable_information
      note: >
        Promotion moves an NPC from background or midground
        toward foreground relevance.

    effects:
      - expanded_memory_scope
      - increased_relationship_web
      - higher_consequence_weight

  demotion_rules:
    conditions:
      - loss_of_power
      - loss_of_relevance
      - replacement_by_superior_actor
    effects:
      - reduced_screen_time
      - narrower_decision_scope

  death_and_absence:
    death_states:
      alive: "Entity remains active."
      missing: "Entity absent; fate unresolved."
      dead: "Entity removed as actor."
      unknown: "Contradictory or obscured reports."

    propagation:
      effects:
        - relationship_reactions
        - rumor_generation
        - faction_shift
      note: >
        Death is a state change, not deletion.
        Its consequences propagate outward.

  authority_limits:
    invariants:
      - "Dynamics never override explicit player action."
      - "No NPC change forces a PC decision."
      - "Escalation must remain reactively justified."

  usage_notes:
    - "Apply dynamics consistently across all NPCs."
    - "Prefer subtle drift over sudden reversals."
    - "Let consequences outlive scenes."
