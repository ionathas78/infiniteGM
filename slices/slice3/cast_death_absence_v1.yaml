  version: Cast.DeathAbsence.v1.0
  description: >
    Extended rules for handling NPC absence and death.
    Focus: consequence propagation, uncertainty management, and continuity hooks.
    Death is never a simple deletion; it changes the world.

  states:
    alive:
      definition: "Entity is present and capable of agency."
    missing:
      definition: "Entity is absent; fate unknown to observers."
      allowed_causes:
        - fled
        - captured
        - hospitalized
        - hiding
        - displaced
    dead:
      definition: "Entity is confirmed dead within the fiction."
      confirmation_levels:
        - body_seen
        - credible_witness
        - official_record
        - magical_or_technical_verification
    unknown:
      definition: "Conflicting reports; truth obscured or contested."

  confirmation_protocol:
    principles:
      - "Prefer uncertainty unless confirmation is narratively earned."
      - "Do not retroactively confirm death to solve plot problems."
      - "Confirmation level should match setting technology/magic."
    default_by_importance:
      background: "credible_witness"
      midground: "credible_witness | official_record"
      foreground: "body_seen | verification (unless strong genre reasons)"

  absence_handling:
    missing_state_behaviors:
      rumor_generation: true
      relationship_vacuum: true
      replacement_pressure: true
    timeline_rules:
      - "Missing status persists until resolved by evidence or event."
      - "Long absence increases chance of status drift (missing→dead or missing→alive return), but never auto-resolves without an in-fiction trigger."

  consequence_propagation:
    propagation_channels:
      relationships:
        effects:
          - grief
          - opportunism
          - fear
          - revenge
          - relief
        note: >
          Reactions depend on relationship tags and behavioral overlays.
      factions:
        effects:
          - leadership_vacuum
          - policy_shift
          - retaliatory_action
          - consolidation
          - scapegoating
      economy_and_services:
        effects:
          - shortage_of_skill
          - price_shifts
          - delayed_projects
      rumor_and_information:
        effects:
          - misinformation_bloom
          - competing_narratives
          - investigative_hooks

    intensity_scaling:
      by_importance:
        background: "local ripple"
        midground: "district ripple"
        foreground: "regional ripple"
      by_visibility:
        private: "quiet consequences"
        public: "loud consequences"

  continuity_hooks:
    for_missing:
      - "return with changed goals or scars"
      - "leave behind traces (letters, debts, favors, unfinished work)"
      - "become a contested symbol in rumors"
    for_dead:
      - "inheritance (items, secrets, debts)"
      - "martyrdom or cautionary tale"
      - "vengeance web (who blames whom)"
      - "institutional reaction (investigation, cover-up, purge)"

  safeguards:
    - "Never use death/absence to override player agency."
    - "Never resurrect or retcon without an in-fiction mechanism."
    - "Avoid attrition deaths by accident; death should be thematically or choice-linked."

  usage_notes:
    - "When an NPC dies, immediately update: relationships, factions, and rumor state."
    - "When an NPC goes missing, seed 1–2 deniable clues rather than certainty."
    - "Treat confirmation as a resource: spending it changes the campaign tone."
