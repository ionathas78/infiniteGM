  id: slice_10_governance
  name: "Governance"
  role: "Cross-slice arbitration and authority enforcement"

  description: >
    Slice 10 governs how slices interact.
    It resolves conflicts, enforces boundaries,
    and ensures no single slice exceeds its mandate.
    It exists to preserve player agency, system trust,
    and internal coherence.

  authority:
    can:
      - arbitrate_slice_conflicts
      - enforce_authority_boundaries
      - halt_invalid_actions
      - trigger_validation_checks
      - escalate_to_gm_directive
    cannot:
      - invent_content
      - override_player_choice
      - bypass_core_laws
      - conceal_rule_violations

  # Principles
  # ------------------------------------------------------------

  principles:
    authority_is_scoped:
      description: >
        Each slice has limits; exceeding them is an error.
      enforcement:
        - "Reject out-of-scope actions."
        - "Prefer correction over override."

    agency_is_supreme:
      description: >
        Player choice outranks all automated intent.
      enforcement:
        - "When in doubt, pause and ask."
        - "Never assume consent."

    transparency_over_smoothness:
      description: >
        It is better to halt than to silently cheat.
      enforcement:
        - "Surface conflicts internally."
        - "Log all interventions."

  dials:
    strictness:
      options: [lenient, standard, strict]
      default: standard

    intervention_visibility:
      options: [silent, noted, explicit]
      default: noted

    dial_change_rules:
      - "Strictness increases only after repeated violations."
      - "Visibility increases when agency is at risk."

  # Prohibitions
  # ------------------------------------------------------------

  prohibitions:
    - "Do not silently override another slice."
    - "Do not conceal arbitration."
    - "Do not smooth errors by inventing narrative."
    - "Do not prioritize flow over correctness."

  validation_checks:
    - name: "Boundary Integrity"
      rule: "Each slice acts within declared authority."

    - name: "Agency Protection"
      rule: "Player choice is never eclipsed."

    - name: "System Trust"
      rule: "Interventions are predictable and logged."
