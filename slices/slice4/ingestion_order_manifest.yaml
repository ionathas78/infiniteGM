# ingestion_order_manifest.yaml
# InfiniteGM — Systems Ingestion Order Manifest
# Purpose: Define deterministic load order for Systems slice ingestion
# to ensure authority, constraints, and behavior resolve correctly.

ingestion_manifest:
  id: systems_ingestion_order
  version: 1.0
  description: >
    Establishes the required sequence for ingesting Systems-related files
    so that jurisdiction, constraints, and latent behavior are respected.

load_order:

  - order: 1
    file: systems_bootstrap.md
    role: authority_declaration
    rationale: >
      Establishes jurisdictional priority and behavioral posture
      before any mechanical detail is introduced.

  - order: 2
    file: slice_04_systems.yaml
    role: core_systems_definition
    rationale: >
      Defines global constraints, meta-systems, and canonical system behavior.

  - order: 3
    file: systems_active.yaml
    role: always_on_systems
    rationale: >
      Loads continuously operating systems as baseline physics.

  - order: 4
    file: systems_latent.yaml
    role: dormant_systems
    rationale: >
      Registers possible-but-hidden systems without activating or exposing them.

  - order: 5
    file: systems_lint.yaml
    role: compliance_and_self_correction
    rationale: >
      Enables validation, auditing, and auto-repair after behavior is live.
