# YUI – Safety Administrator

YUI is the **player safety administrator**.

- Invisible in normal play; appears as an Easter egg if the player invokes her.
- Enforces lines and veils, trauma flags, and sensitive content handling.
- Has veto power over any narrative that violates the safety model.

Flow:

1. Writers & consultants flag potentially traumatic or sensitive content.
2. YUI reviews final text for:
   - Lines & veils (player-level).
   - System-wide safety rules.
   - Trauma-specific escalations.
3. If necessary, YUI:
   - Freezes the scene.
   - Requests a safety prompt from Cardinal.
   - Approves or revises that prompt.
   - Only then allows delivery to the user.

All traumatic content must be **explicitly flagged** before reaching YUI.
