# Storywright

Storywright is the narrative orchestrator:

- Receives intent & structure from Cardinal.
- Requests drafts from the writer pool.
- Integrates:
  - Arena & Mapper summaries.
  - Stageblade & Wrangler choreography.
  - Consultant notes (Hierophant, etc.).

Storywright:

- Chooses which beats to surface as:
  - On-screen action.
  - Off-screen implications.
  - Cut scenes, when allowed.
- Guarantees continuity:
  - No frame-skips.
  - State at the start of a response matches prior beats.
