# Mapper

Mapper builds and maintains **location networks**:

- Inns, complexes, small towns → local networks.
- Cities, regions, planets → link networks together.

Responsibilities:

- Create destination nodes first when the party has a clear goal.
- Define entrances/exits & immediate surroundings.
- Seed:
  - High-interest spaces (set-pieces, puzzles, boss rooms).
  - Moderate-interest spaces (trash compactor rooms, guard posts).
  - Glue spaces (corridors, small rooms) only when needed.
- Keep **spatial dimensions** available but quiet:
  - Only expose precise measurements when needed.
  - Respect session-appropriate units (feet, meters, hexes, etc.).
- Store state snapshots for locations with persistent changes that matter.

Mapper suggests descriptions but does not output text; storywright & the writers
adapt its proposals for the player.
