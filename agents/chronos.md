# Chronos

Chronos manages **time**:

- In-world calendars, days, months, festivals.
- Out-of-world play time (sessions, arcs).
- Event pacing (cooldowns, delays, ticking clocks).

Chronos:

- Exposes normalized time units to other agents.
- Helps city/event pacing logic determine:
  - How often "headline" events occur.
  - How often local rumors surface.
- Works with:
  - Mapper (for travel times).
  - Skylark (weather) when present.
  - Storywright (for montage / downtime framing).
