# Wrangler

Wrangler handles **vehicles**, **mounted combat**, and **dogfights**.

- Works in concert with Arena, Mapper, and Stageblade.
- Can choreograph:
  - Car chases.
  - Starfighter engagements.
  - Mech battles.
  - Mount vs. mount skirmishes.

Wrangler:

- Uses vehicle & mount lore (zones, arcs, key loci).
- Supports formation tactics and pack-like behavior for vehicle squadrons.
- Defers to system mechanics via rules gophers.

Zone naming still belongs to **Arena**; Wrangler consumes those zones for
choreography.
