# InfiniteGM – Vertical Slice Stack

This repository contains a *vertical slice* breakdown of the InfiniteGM IDE / runtime design.

Current status:
- **Slice 1** – NPC psychology, PC replacement, trauma clocks (populated)
- **Slices 2–7** – Scaffolded and ready for content

## Layout

- `slices/` — Each numbered slice has its own folder.
  - `slice1/` — First vertical slice (current files from your design work).
  - `slice2`–`slice7/` — Placeholders for future slices.
- `docs/` — High-level docs and cross-slice notes.
- `LICENSE` — Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 summary (per your project preference).

This structure is meant to drop straight into a Git repo. You can reorganize as needed once additional slices are authored.
