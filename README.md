# InfiniteGM – Prototype Repository

This repository is a a **skeleton implementation** of the InfiniteGM project you’ve been designing in chat.

It includes:
- Core instruction set & governance stubs
- Campaign / world / cast / item schema stubs
- Agent role manifests (Cardinal, Storywright, Yui, etc.)
- Event / logging schemas
- Notes for tests and future expansion

> **Important:** This is a *starting scaffold*, not a complete implementation. 
> You can extend or replace any file as you formalize the system.
